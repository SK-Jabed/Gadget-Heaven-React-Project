## Project Description
**Welcome to Dream 11 Cricket Team !!!** The 'Dream 11 Cricket' Team webpage is an interactive platform that allows users to create their own fantasy cricket team by selecting players from a pool. It features a smooth user interface with functionalities such as choosing players based on available coins, adding or removing players from the team and clear feedback notifications using React-Toastify. The design also includes a stylish footer and newsletter section, providing a complete and engaging experience for cricket enthusiasts.

## 5 features of your website/project
1. **Player Selection and Validation:**:
   - Users can choose players for their cricket team while ensuring they stay within a coin budget. The application checks if a player is already selected or if the team has reached the maximum limit and displays alerts using React-Toastify for better notifications.

2. **Dynamic Player Management:**:
   - The app allows users to add or remove players dynamically. Players can be removed from the selected list easily, and users can choose to add more players if they want to modify their team selection.

3. **Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS:**:
   - The project is styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean, responsive layout. The integration of DaisyUI components helps maintain a consistent design theme, while React ensures the user interface is interactive and user-friendly.

## List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project:
Here are the technologies I used in the 'Dream 11 Cricket team' project:
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For basic styling and layout adjustments.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for faster styling.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the web page.
- **React JS**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Build tool to set up the development environment for React.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment to run JavaScript on the server. It also includes npm (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies.
- **npm / Yarn**: Package managers to install, manage, and update packages and libraries needed for your React project.
- **Babel**: JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript (ES6+) into backward-compatible JavaScript that can run on older browsers.
- **ESLint / Prettier**: Tools to maintain code quality and consistency by enforcing coding styles and formatting.
These technologies helped me efficiently build and style the 'Dream 11 Cricket team' webpage.
