# React Fundamentals Used in Gadget Heaven
1. **Components**  
   - Built reusable and composable components for different parts of the UI, such as the Navbar, ProductCard, Cart, and Wishlist.

2. **Props**  
   - Used props to pass data to child components, making them dynamic and reusable.

3. **State Management**  
   - Managed component state with `useState` to handle features like the cart, wishlist, and active states within the Dashboard.

4. **Conditional Rendering**  
   - Rendered components conditionally based on user interactions or state changes, such as switching between Cart and Wishlist views.

5. **React Router**  
   - Utilized `react-router-dom` for navigation and route management, enabling seamless page transitions across sections like `/dashboard` and `/about`.

6. **Event Handling**  
   - Handled user interactions, such as button clicks for adding items to the cart or toggling active tabs.

7. **Local Storage**  
   - Used local storage to save cart data and user preferences, allowing data persistence across sessions.

8. **Dynamic Class Names**  
   - Applied conditional class names to dynamically change styles, particularly for active button states and theming.

9. **Reusable Utility Functions**  
   - Created helper functions (e.g., handling active states, calculating total prices) to encapsulate and reuse logic across components.

10. **Effect Hook (`useEffect`)**  
    - Leveraged `useEffect` to perform side effects, such as fetching data or updating the cart from local storage when a component mounts.

11. **Custom Styling with Tailwind CSS**  
    - Styled components using Tailwind CSS classes to create a consistent, responsive, and modern UI.

12. **Third-Party Libraries**  
    - Integrated third-party libraries like `react-rating-stars-component` for additional features, such as displaying dynamic ratings.

This list provides an overview of the fundamental React concepts applied in the Gadget Heaven project.


# Data Handling and Management
In the Gadget Heaven project, **Local Storage** is used to handle and manage data. Local Storage allows us to save the user's cart and wishlist data on the client side, ensuring data persistence even if the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens the browser. By using Local Storage, we provide a seamless user experience, where the items added to the cart or wishlist are retained between sessions without requiring server-side storage.

The usage of Local Storage involves:
- Saving cart and wishlist data whenever the user adds or removes items.
- Loading data from Local Storage when the app initializes to restore the user's previous session state.


# Key Features of Gadget Heaven
1. **Dynamic Product Listings**  
   Displays a wide range of gadgets across multiple categories, such as phones, laptops, and accessories, with real-time data rendering.

2. **Cart and Wishlist Functionality**  
   Allows users to add products to their cart and wishlist, with persistent data storage using Local Storage to retain user preferences even after refreshing the page.

3. **Dashboard with Quick Navigation**  
   A dedicated dashboard allows users to seamlessly switch between their Cart and Wishlist, providing a quick overview of saved products and enhancing ease of use.

4. **Detailed Product Page**  
   Each product has a dedicated page with extensive details, including specifications, price, availability, and a dynamic rating button, helping users make informed decisions.

5. **Comprehensive Statistics Visualization**  
   Includes interactive data visualizations using Recharts to display product statistics such as price trends, popularity, and ratings, helping users analyze gadget trends at a glance.
